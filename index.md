title: Doze - Cybersecurity Portfolio & About Me
---

# Hi, I'm Doze 👋

I'm an aspiring cybersecurity professional based in England, working towards breaking into the field. Passionate about defensive security, ethical hacking, building secure systems with code, solving complex problems, and constantly learning new tools and techniques.

Currently self-studying via platforms like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and free resources, with a focus on networking fundamentals, Linux, scripting, and vulnerability assessment.

## Skills
- **Languages & Scripting** — Lua, HTML/CSS, Python (learning for automation & tooling)
- **Tools & Platforms** — Git/GitHub, Jellyfin (for secure self-hosted services), Linux CLI, Wireshark basics, VirtualBox/VMware for labs
- **Concepts & Other** — Networking (TCP/IP, subnets), Basic pentesting methodology, Homelab setup, OSINT, Secure coding practices

(Adding more as I complete certs/modules — e.g., CompTIA Security+, eJPT prep)

## Projects & Homelabs
### Private Streaming Service (Secure Homelab Media Server)
- Built and secured a personal Jellyfin server for streaming media across devices.
- Implemented HTTPS with Let's Encrypt, firewall rules (UFW), user authentication, and isolated it in a VM.
- Focused on hardening: disabled unnecessary ports, regular updates, and monitoring logs.
- [GitHub Repo/Link if public] | [Screenshots or diagram coming soon]

### Project 2: [e.g., TryHackMe Write-up or Custom Tool]
- [Brief description: e.g., "Created a simple Lua-based script for automating basic reconnaissance tasks."]
- Tech used: Lua scripting, integrated with tools like nmap.
- [Repo link] | ![Screenshot](/assets/images/project2-screenshot.png)

(Add 2-4 more as you build them — write-ups of CTFs, vulnerable VM setups, or scripts are gold for cyber portfolios.)

### Other / In Progress
- Building a home lab with pfSense firewall, vulnerable machines for practice.
- Completing rooms on TryHackMe/HackTheBox → planning write-ups here.

## Experience / Learning Timeline
- **Self-Taught Cybersecurity Journey** (2024–Present)
  - Completed beginner paths on TryHackMe (e.g., Pre-Security, Intro to Offensive Pentesting).
  - Set up secure homelab environment.
  - Scripting side projects in Lua/Python.
- **Previous Roles / Freelance** (if any — e.g., IT support, coding gigs)
  - [Add bullets with achievements, even non-cyber ones that show transferable skills like problem-solving.]
